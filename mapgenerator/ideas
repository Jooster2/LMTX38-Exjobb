Grid-creator makes a simple grid
Place start and finish
Find path between start and finish

Move from finish to start and place modules
For each module, create branches, 1-3, where each branch is for a spec car
On the branch, if for small car, randomly place partedcells with elevation
On the branch, randomly place modules (rarely)
Branch for that module
---
Placing partedcells:
Create partedcell. All small cells know their small neighbours.
Update large neighbours
